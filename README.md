# Titanic Repo
* This page aims to publish my codes on [Titanic Challenge on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
* A mirror of this page will be published on Kaggle as well. It will be on R Markdown format and links will be published soon.
* I have used Classification Tree, k-Nearest-Neighbors, Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes techniques to find out who has survived from Titanic disaster while employing validation techniques such as n-Fold cross-validation, stepwise regression or pruning.
* My success rates were as follows:
  * Ctree: 0.77033
  * kNN : 0.53110
  * Logistic Regression : 0.76555
  * Naive Bayes: 0.74162
